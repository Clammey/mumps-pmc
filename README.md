# Thank you for looking into my repository!
I designed all the projects I showcased, on this GitHub account. I wrote every line, with the first line being typed Friday, July 5th.

# Scenario 

In the timeframe I was scheduled for an interview on July 12th, 2024. I learned a fascinating language made by Epic.

This is simply a pure example of a database, creating a user, and fetching a user, and creating a factorial calculator.

I do not have access to a GTM install, Windows VS Code can only go so far in this extension.

I'd love to learn more about this language, and see its true capabilities. Its documentation was used thoroughly throughout this script.
